To install Tailwind, follow https://camerondwyer.com/2020/07/09/using-tailwind-css-in-an-angular-cli-app/ 
Take care woz you will need to install postcss@8, because by default it installs v7 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63858991/how-to-setup-tailwind-for-a-new-angular-project)
Also follow this https://fullyunderstood.com/get-started-with-angular-tailwind-css/ because it helps to reduce the the size of styles (the tailwind.config.js is the solution)
